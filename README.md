Game explanation:
In this assignment we were asked to code a pokemon game. the game works like this:
when you run the program, a window will come up asking you to enter your id and the level you would like to play.
this code was done using javafx scene builder.

The game is a robotic one, where the computer playes by itself and tries to get the best score. 
Whilst the game is running there is no humen interfeirence! 
once you hit the start game button- the game will commence.
in the game there are 24 levels (0-23), and the level differ from each-other by the graphs, amount of agents,amount of pokemon and time for level.
when you start the game - the clock will start automatically.
a new window will open presenting a directed weighted graph, with nodes (blue), edges (dark grey), pokemon (orange or green-depending on wether their on consecutive nodes or not) and agents (red).
the point of the game is to eat as many pokemon in the most efficient way (the least amount of "move" commands).
agents "catch" pokemon by running across there edge. once a pokemon gets cought he will reapear in a new random place on the graph.
whilst the game is running you can see thee agents running around catching the different pokemon as our code instructs them to.
when the time runs out you will get a score that marks how efficient your code is.
we tackeled this assignment using a few main functions and algorithms which are presented fuuly in the wiki page.



Note:
we started coding using Harels repo in github but when we were doing the graphics of the signup page we needed to open a new java fx project and copy over the files. 
we then accidently connected that project to a new repo in Yonatans github. 
so, if you would like to see our process you can look also this current repo and also at https://github.com/HarelCohen30/ex2_new.
